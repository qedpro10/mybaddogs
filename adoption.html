                    <h3 class="drtip">Beauregard von Dufus<i class="fa fa-paw" aria-hidden="true"></i><i class="fa fa-paw" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="drtiptext">Difficulty rating: 2 out of 5</span></h3>
                    <p>I don't know what dufus means but my foster mom says I'm totally one.  She calls me Bo-Bo for short except when I'm in trouble, which is not often cause I'm a good guy.  I'm house-trained, love other dogs, cats, and kids. </p>
                    <p>If you throw the ball I will get it over and over.  I walk well on a leash, love car rides and swimming in the river.  The only thing I don't like is thunderstorms.  When there is a storm at night, my job is to lay as close as possible to my foster mom to make sure she doesn't fall asleep while protecting us.</p>
                    <p>I will bark when somebody new comes to the door but its only because I want them to know I'm here so they will pet me and possibly throw the ball.  Also, I come with my own ball throwing stick.  Since I've been with my foster mom, I've added cookie monster and couch potato to my resume.</p>
                    <p>My special ability is that I can carry 3 tennis balls in my mouth.</p>

                    <p>I'm really really really smart and I don't like laying around all day, so I tend to find things to do.  My foster mom says that I need to get a job because all the landscaping is done.  She doesn't need any more holes dug under the fence and apparently I've dug up and dragged my last bush into the house.</p>
                    <p>My foster mom will tell you that I was the one who dismembered the stuff animal collection in the backyard, but she couldn't prove anything.  Besides how could I get them when they were staring at me from on top of a 7ft chifferobe.</p>
                    <p>I love car rides.  Often times my foster mom and me will go for a drive at night to relax.  When a good song comes on the radio we'll both sing along.  Good times.</p>
                    <p>Speaking of time, I am a great alarm clock.  I will wake you up at 6am every morning (plus or minus 1 minute) to go for a run.  I don't even worry about whether its a weekend or a holiday or raining.  Adopt me and you'll be doing a marathon before you know it.</p>
                    <p>My special ability is being able to clean the butter dish without moving it on the countertop.</p>

                    <p>My previous owner was a Star Trek fan but he got real sick and couldn't look after me anymore.  My foster mom says I am a great dog.  I'm a real German - German Shepherd, not one of those American - German shepherds with the bad hips.</p>
                    <p>I do agility and fly ball, and I'm really good at it.  So if you like winning - adopt me.  I could have gone to police school but my previous owner was afraid I would become mean.  And because of cats which are like super tasty tribbles.  My foster mom has, on more than one occasion, uttered the words "It's dead Jim".  And no - its not impossible.  Its quite easy - you just grab them by the neck and snap it.</p>
                    <p>Kids are a different story.  I love kids and I will sleep with them on their bed at night to keep them company. When my buddy's Boy Scout troup has a sleepover in the backyard, I watch out for them all night.</p>
                    <p>If I get a little peckish I will open the door to the pantry to get a snack.  And I've encoded all the doorknobs in the house with doggy braille.</p>
                    <p>My special ability is that no one will rob your house when I am home.</p>

                    <h3 class="drtip">Chewbacca<i class="fa fa-paw" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="drtiptext">Difficulty rating: 1 out of 5</span></h3>
                    <p>Call me Chewy for short, or Chew-Chew if you like. You might recognize me, I'm Lassie's brother from another mother.</p>
                    <p>As I get older I am coming to terms with my puppyhood.  I grew up resenting my brother's fame.  It drove me to a life of drugs and I ended up living on the streets.  I was finally arrested in Texas after I got hit by a car.  They fixed me up and did a serious deworming.  I won't bore you with the details cause my foster mom is not quite over it.  Something about not being able to unsee what she saw.</p>
                    <p>Anyway, here I am.  I love women and kids and I will follow you around the house all day, no matter where you go, just to keep you company.  I like to sleep in my own bed but it has to be in the same room with you.  I don't need to get up early.  If you want to go for a walk, I will not pull you even if there are other dogs around.  And if you're not feeling up to it, I can watch TV with you instead.</p>
                    <p>My special ability is being able to give you hugs when your sitting on the toilet no matter what number you're doing.</p>
